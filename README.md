cragnon.js
==========

A javascript library (my first) for doing simple DOM manipulations; wanted to dig deeper in the DOM. Will include methods for adding, removing nodes, manipulating attributes, ajax calls, and probably other stuff. Will try to use the document/element querySelector methods unless they have limits, I'm as of yet unaware. Otherwise, I may write (or find) a library to use to parse CSS selectors.


Where did the name come from?
-----------------------------

  The idea for the library started out to be a simple Chrome/Chromium/Webkit?/Mozilla? (basically standards compliant) compatible library just for fun. Completeness/cross-browser compatibility would come later. So, it started out to be simple and incomplete. Cro-Magnon Man has historically been seen as a simple cave man and the "crom" in the begning lent itself to the shortening to "cr" for Chrome/Chromium. I suck at naming stuff; this is the best I could do. :p
  
  tl;dr : Cro-Magnon --> "Cro-M" --> (Chrome ~ Chromium = Cr) --> cr-agnon --> cragnon  :D


Versions
--------
Initial Commit
v0.0.1 - Only the beginnings of a library are present lots of bugs being worked out as I learn the ins and outs. Have started test code as I go along.

One more thing...
Wonder if it would be a good idea to make a base library that uses the proper, standards way of doing DOM manipulations, and then having other code override functions when
